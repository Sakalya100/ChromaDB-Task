## Task Overview:
Most of our popular client projects involve building Q&A bots using client documents or creating natural language to SQL bots. Typically, we start these projects with a Streamlit chatbot and eventually deliver them via FastAPI.

## Your Assignment:
You will replicate a project from the following videos. While doing so, please use Chroma DB instead of Pinecone and GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4, as these reflect our current project environments more accurately.
